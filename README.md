## üìÇ Featured Projects
### <a href="https://github.com/dmahali1983/Insurance_Risk_Analysis_RAG">1. Insurance_Risk_Analysis_RAG</a>
Description: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for insurance risk analysis, leveraging NLP, machine learning, and deep learning techniques.

Technologies: Python, BERT, GPT-2, Docker, AWS SageMaker

### <a href="https://github.com/dmahali1983/MLOPS">2. MLOps</a>
Description: A comprehensive repository demonstrating the deployment of machine learning models using MLOps practices.

Technologies: Python, Docker, AWS SageMaker
### <a href="https://github.com/dmahali1983/aws-sagemaker">3. Bank Marketing Analysis</a>
Description: This project focuses on analyzing bank marketing data using XGBOOST in AWS SageMaker. The data relates to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution, with the classification goal of predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit..

Technologies: Python, AWS SageMaker

### <a href="https://github.com/dmahali1983/Computer-Vision">4. Image Classificaiton using ResNet18</a>
Description: The goal of this project is to develop an image classification model that can accurately classify images of animals from the Animals-10 dataset using the ResNet18 architecture. The Animals-10 dataset consists of 10 classes of animals, and the task is to build a deep learning model capable of distinguishing between these classes based on the images provided.

Technologies: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow

### <a href="https://github.com/dmahali1983/Deep-Learning">5. Deep Learning</a>
Description: Developed various deep learning models and their configurations for different use cases. For binary classification, a model with one layer of 100 neurons uses the Adam optimizer with Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and BCE with Logits as loss functions. In multiclass classification, a similar architecture (1 layer with 100 neurons) is employed, optimized with Adam and trained with Cross-Entropy Loss. For hyperparameter tuning, both Adam and AdamW optimizers are used with Cross-Entropy Loss. Lastly, anomaly detection tasks, particularly using Autoencoders or RNNs, are optimized with Adam and use Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss. These configurations are designed to address different types of machine learning problems effectively, leveraging specific loss functions and optimization techniques.

Technologies: Python, Keras, TensorFlow

### <a href="https://github.com/dmahali1983/LinearRegression_SalesPrediction">6. Linear Regression Sales Prediction</a>
Description: A project focused on predicting sales using linear regression models.

Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn

### <a href="https://github.com/dmahali1983/Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals">7. Predicting Credit Card Approvals</a>
Description: An analysis and model to predict credit card approval decisions based on applicant data.

Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn
